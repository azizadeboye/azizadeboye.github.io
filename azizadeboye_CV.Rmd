##### SUMMARY OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
I am a statistician training as a research biostatistician with a focus on computational modeling of diseases with a background that encompasses clinical, molecular and quantitative experience. I have extensive experience in conducting field work and managing data in large field-based research operations, performing algorithmitic computations and model development in communicable and non-communicable diseases. Currently I am working on tuberculosis transmission dynamics by building statistical, mathematical and spatio-temporal models.

## EMPLOYMENT    

University of Fort Hare, Alice, **Graduate Student Researcher** \hfill 2017- present 

Advisor: Prof. YongSong Qin \hfill Alice, South Africa 

- As a **researcher**, I am working on improving the measurement that examines the use of a relatively novel methodology in joint modelling of Longitudinal mixed models and Survival models with weighted function apply to biomedical and clinical trial data. In my research, I developed an integrated weighted function for likelihood estimate using a Bayesian approach and statistical inference analysis for this methodology in which both strength and computational intensity of previous approach is relaxed, and requirements are explicitly satisfied. This was delivered in a computer-based program using WinBugs and R packages that is freely available. I am excited to share and continue to explore this methodology and collaborate to expand its potential. I am currently modeling spatial-temporal analysis of tuberculosis and COVID-19 varies over space and time, to determine if the intervention has an effect on the vector density in neighboring areas and, if so, the duration of this effect.  


University of Fort Hare, Alice, **Lecturer Assistant/Data Analyst** \hfill 2014- 2019  

Employer: Department of Statistics, University of Fort Hare \hfill Alice, South Africa 

- I was a **Lecturer assistant** assisting lecturers and tutoring undergraduate students based on the core subjects offered by Statistics departments, providing academic support and development to undergraduate students that offer statistics as a course in all the faculties and assisting lecturers in the department to conduct lectures in the case of lecturer unavailability or missed classes. I was helping the weak students with extra classes for them to be able to cope and go at the same pace as other students and assisting students in choosing courses to offer according to departmental criteria and counselling them towards acquiring academic excellence.
